## 2026-06-14 — Review by Reviewer Session

### Rules (apply immediately, no exceptions)

**R1 — Unit conversion guard before any DB write**
Before writing to any DB column and asserting `typed_value == DB_value`, check if the column has a unit conversion. Pressure and rate columns in EC store SI/base units in DB but display configured units in UI. Factor for pressure: ~14.5038 (psi ↔ bar). Never use a naive equality oracle on these columns — derive the expected DB value from the live ground truth: `expected = typed_display * DB_before / UI_before`.

**R2 — Read current value before any write (no null assumptions)**
Never assume a cell is null before checking. Always read the current DB value before performing a write-then-diff assertion. Assuming null and writing 0/null to a non-null cell caused a 192-cell data incident on 2026-06-14. Oracle Flashback saved it — but Flashback has a time window. Resolve OBJECT_ID and read current value upfront, every time.

**R3 — Document parked items with a one-line blocker**
When parking a test or pattern, always write a one-line reason in the commit message AND in the relevant design doc. "Parked" without a reason is unresumable and unhandable. Acceptable format: `PARKED: <screen> — <specific blocker> — next step: <action>`.

**R4 — Sub-daily patterns need datetime-keyed DbVerify**
PWEL_SUB_DAY_STATUS (and similar sub-daily tables) key on `(OBJECT_ID, DAYTIME[+time], SUMMER_TIME)` — not `TRUNC(date)`. The daily DbVerify helper will silently match wrong rows. Always create a datetime-keyed variant when the PK includes time.

**R5 — ec-worker must be confirmed running before N3 tests**
Before running any status process (N3 pattern), verify ec-worker is up and its scheduler is in RUNNING state (not STANDBY). ORA-06569 with "no elements" = empty data scope, not an infra failure. ORA-06569 on a date with real P data = ec-worker is down or scheduler is STANDBY.

### Observations (good patterns to keep)

- **Self-cleaning oracle pattern in DbVerify**: re-executing the production rule's own `WHERE_FORMULA` to compute expected violations is the correct approach — prevents oracle drift from deployed logic. Keep this pattern for all new check-rule tests.
- **T1/T2/T3 layering**: working well. Do not collapse layers for convenience — isolation of screen-specific vs pattern-level vs universal concerns is paying off.
- **WR.0001 canary after each new suite**: good practice, keep it. Catches regressions in shared keywords before they propagate.
- **Timestamp-based test codes**: good. Never use fixed test codes — they cause state pollution across runs.

### Gaps still open (worker to address)

| Gap | Owner | Priority |
|-----|-------|----------|
| 3 Financial Objects parked — root causes not documented | Worker | 🔴 High |
| N3 V→A daily suite — build-ready but not built | Worker | 🟡 Medium |
| N3 V→A monthly suite — separate screen, thin T3 needed | Worker | 🟡 Medium |
| Dispatching Pipeline slice — not started | Worker | 🟢 Low |
| Column unit-conversion registry — no central list of which columns need conversion | Worker | 🔴 High |
